Platform App Builder Recertification

* Customize related lists directly from the Lightning App Builder instead of the page layout editor with the new Dynamic Related List – Single component.
* Choose the list’s fields and sort order, apply filters, and give the list a descriptive name.
* To see the most relevant records, set up two or more related lists with different filters on the same object.
* Create, Save, and Run Tests for Your Flows in Flow Builder
	* Before you activate a record-triggered flow, you can now test it to quickly verify its expected results and identify flow run-time failures. In Flow Builder, you create, save, and run flow tests.
 	* Previously, you debugged a flow manually to troubleshoot failures each time they occurred. Now, you create and save a flow test from a debug run. Then each time you modify the flow, you can run the test.
 	* Flow tests now support scheduled paths and packaging. Flow tests do not support flows that run when a record is deleted.
 

### Deflect Cases with Einstein Article Recommendations for Flows
* Integrate the power and flexibility of Flow Builder with Einstein Article Recommendations. Enable smart email auto-response to quickly answer customer questions and deflect cases with knowledge articles.
* To add article recommendations to your flow, select Create Article Recommendations from the Action menu in Flow Builder.



Deliver to Your Customers with Custom Address Fields
Improve address data accuracy and your users’ experience with custom address fields. For example, add a “warehouse address” field to a standard or custom object. 
Your users can enter a custom address, or they can use the Google lookup to search for an address. 
Then you can access each address that’s stored in a custom address field, either as a structured compound data type or as individual address components.

Why: Custom address fields are now supported for dynamic forms for Flows. 
If the end user’s personal language is a fully supported or end-user language in Salesforce, the labels for the components of a custom address now appear in that language. 
You can add a state in the State and Country picklist with a name and code that match the name and code of an existing state in another country. 
And the documentation now clarifies expected behavior for address fields around marking fields as required and load times.


### Enhance More Object Record Pages with Dynamic Forms
* You can make your account, including person account, contact, and opportunity record pages more robust by configuring them with Dynamic Forms.

How: In the Lightning App Builder, open an account, including person account, contact, or opportunity record page. 
Click the new Fields tab, and place fields anywhere on the page. Or automate the process by migrating your Record Detail component to use Dynamic Forms with the click of a button.


### Allow Multiple Values in Restriction or Scoping Rule Record Criteria
Configure a restriction or scoping rule to use a comma-separated list of IDs or values in the record criteria.

Where: Restriction rules are available in Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions. Scoping rules are available in Lightning Experience in Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions.

How: To create a restriction or scoping rule using more than one value in the record criteria, add a comma as a delimiter to separate the ID or string values. To include a single value that contains a comma, surround the value with double quotes (”).
